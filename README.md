# calc-web-next
Calculator web app on Next.js

## Requirements
Build a simple calculator web application based on the attached UI mockup.
<img src="img.png" alt="Calculator" style="width:450px; height:auto;" />

### Tech stack
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

### Scope
- Support basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- Input via on-screen buttons
- Clear/reset functionality
- Sensible handling of edge cases

The goal is to assess code structure, state management, and overall implementation quality. Exact (or close enough) UI pixel matching is required.

### Deliverables
- Git repository with the solution
- Short README with setup instructions and any assumptions made
